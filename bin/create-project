#!/usr/bin/env node

// allows us to us es modules without needing to transpile to different node js
// versions that may not have that support
require = require('esm')(module/*, options*/);

// call the cli fn from cli.js and pass in all the args from the command line
require('../src/cli').cli(process.argv);

// GOTCHA: this also is running node so it takes regular node comments
